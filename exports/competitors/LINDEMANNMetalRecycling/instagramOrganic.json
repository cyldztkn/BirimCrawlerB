It‚Äôs still in full holiday mode ‚Äì with cookies galore! üéÑüç™ Leftover treats are piled high, and while munching is still its favorite pastime, this year Cookie Monster had a new idea: Why not recycle those leftover cookies into something creative? üßë‚Äçüç≥‚ú®\n¬†\nThe cookies were crumbled, layered, and coated in rich chocolate. üç´üéâ Cookie Monster, with a proud grin, called it ‚Äúcookie recycling‚Äù and turned the leftovers into delightful sweet creations ‚Äì though, of course, not without taste-testing more than a few along the way! üòã\n¬†\nAt LINDEMANN, we understand the power of recycling. While Cookie Monster reimagines cookies, we focus on reimagining metals. With our innovative shredders, balers, and shears, we make metal recycling efficient, sustainable, and future-ready. ‚öôÔ∏èüåç\n¬†\nTake a moment to relax, recharge, and enjoy the final days of this year ‚Äì with a touch of creativity and sustainability. Wishing you restful and joyful moments from all of us at LINDEMANN! üéÑüíô\n¬†\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #SustainableFuture #CookieMonster #Cookies",

As the steel industry moves toward sustainable practices, electric arc furnaces are becoming central to expansion plans, while countries like¬†China¬†are raising the bar on quality standards for imported materials.\n\nLooking further ahead, scrap demand is expected to reach¬†964 million tons by 2050¬†‚Äì a milestone aligned with global steel producers‚Äò ambitions for¬†carbon neutrality.\n\nAt LINDEMANN Metal Recycling, we are proud to support this transformation of the circular economy by delivering innovative solutions that ensure a sustainable and efficient use of resources for a better tomorrow.\n\nSteel‚Äôs green future is being forged with scrap.
