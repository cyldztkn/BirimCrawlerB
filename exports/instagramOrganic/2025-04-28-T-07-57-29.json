The machine is very productive on all grades of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, shearing with the 1000T window crosshead or baling with the 180T baling ram. \n\n💪🏽 The power, strength and speed of its cutting is giving very pleasing results for its new owners. This machine, fitted with the 600HP Scania diesel engine, operators control cabin and tunnel pusher ram is easily capable of 25-30 Tonnes per hour of production, depending upon material and cut length. \n\nWe wish Philip & Stephen all the best for the future with their new Lefort Koloss 1000 TS 🙌",

Der Austausch mit Branchenexperten hat einmal mehr bestätigt, wie wichtig nachhaltige Lösungen für die Zukunft sind.\n\nEin besonderes Highlight war die beeindruckende Ausstellung von Hans op de Beeck, die im Rahmen des Kongresses stattfand. Seine Schwarz-Weiß-Werke boten eine künstlerische Reflexion über Zeit, Raum und Vergänglichkeit – ein spannender Kontrast zu den zukunftsweisenden Themen der IARC.\n\nEin großes Dankeschön an alle, die uns besucht haben!

Der Kunde setzt die Maschinen ein, um Steine zu sieben, die er für den Bau von Steinzäunen benötigt. Das Förderband wird dabei für den effizienten Transport der verschiedenen Fraktionen genutzt.\nDie VS BIG Zweideck Testmaschine wurde erfolgreich getestet, und die Ergebnisse haben die Erwartungen des Kunden voll erfüllt. Die Maschine arbeitete zuverlässig und effizient, wobei die verschiedenen Fraktionen präzise getrennt wurden, genau wie erwartet. Der Test bestätigte die Leistungsfähigkeit der Maschine unter realen Bedingungen, und die Siebung erfolgte mit der gewünschten Effizienz und Genauigkeit.\nDie VS BIG Testmaschine ist mit folgenden technischen Merkmalen ausgestattet:\n• Oben deck: 130x130 mm Siebblech für grobe Fraktionen\n• Untendeck: 90x90 mm Siebblech für kleinere Fraktionen\n• Trennplatte für die Bildung einer dritten Fraktion\n• Fixierte Metalbremse statt der herkömmlichen Gummibremse, was eine längere Haltbarkeit und bessere Leistung garantiert\n• 400V Elektroanschluss für eine zuverlässige Stromversorgung\nDas Förderband CB 3000 wurde mit einem fixierten Gestell unten geliefert, anstatt dem Standardgestell mit Rädern. Diese Anpassung sorgt für eine noch stabilere und effizientere Handhabung, besonders bei schwereren Materialien und längeren Transportwegen.\nWir sind stolz darauf, dass unsere Maschinen zur Qualität und Effizienz dieses spannenden Projekts beitragen und freuen uns auf die weiteren Erfolge unseres Kunden.\n \n- Mehr über unseren Maschinen finden Sie hier: https://ascotec.eu/\n- VS BIG & CB 3000 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZS-su9sozQ\n- Unser Ansprechpartner aus ATM Recyclingsystems: Sergei Shaveko +43 664 88 35 53 68\n- Folgen Sie uns:\no Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ascobh/\no Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/asco_bh/\no LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/asco-bh/\no YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/ASCOTEC",

I ragazzi, divisi a gruppi, hanno visitato l’officina e gli uffici della ditta dove sono state spiegate loro le varie figure professionali. Il tutto nell’ottica della scelta della corretta scuola secondaria di secondo grado. I ragazzi, accompagnati dai professori, hanno mostrato interesse e fatto domande. Speriamo di essere stati d’aiuto nella scelta del loro percorso di studi che li preparerà alla vita lavorativa. In bocca al lupo ragazzi!",

After so many decades, the wear and tear of time had taken a heavy toll on the machine, which had to be dismantled and painstakingly restored. Alongside other historical models, all restored to their former glory, it is a witness to the development of mechanical engineering in our company's history. 👏\nTen years after the museum opened, Andreas and Alois are still part of our team and have made impressive careers since then. 🚀\n💡Read more here: ➡️ https://bit.ly/3Assyxo\n\nRestaurierung historischer SENNEBOGEN Maschinen - ehemaliges Azubiprojekt mit Erfolgsgeschichte 🔧\nUnsere Mitarbeiter Andreas und Alois starteten ihre Karriere bei SENNEBOGEN mit einem außergewöhnlichen Projekt: der Restaurierung historischer Maschinen zur Eröffnung des Erich Sennebogen Museums um 2014. ✨ \nEine dieser Maschinen war ein SENNEBOGEN S 802 Seilbagger, in Produktion zwischen 1958 und 1960.

Um in dieser kritischen Situation schnell und effizient zu handeln, hat das Wasserstraßen- und Schifffahrtsamt (WSA) Mosel-Saar-Lahn seit Jahren einen Rahmenvertrag mit dem Trierer Kranverleih-Experten Steil Kranarbeiten. \n\nDank dieser Zusammenarbeit und modernster #Liebherr-Technik konnte das beschädigte Tor geborgen und ein neues eingebaut werden.
