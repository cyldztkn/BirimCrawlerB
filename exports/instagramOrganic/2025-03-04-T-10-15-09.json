As the steel industry moves toward sustainable practices, electric arc furnaces are becoming central to expansion plans, while countries like China are raising the bar on quality standards for imported materials.\n\nLooking further ahead, scrap demand is expected to reach 964 million tons by 2050 – a milestone aligned with global steel producers‘ ambitions for carbon neutrality.\n\nAt LINDEMANN Metal Recycling, we are proud to support this transformation of the circular economy by delivering innovative solutions that ensure a sustainable and efficient use of resources for a better tomorrow.\n\nSteel’s green future is being forged with scrap. Are we ready to meet the challenge? 💪✨\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #Steel",

I ragazzi, divisi a gruppi, hanno visitato l’officina e gli uffici della ditta dove sono state spiegate loro le varie figure professionali. Il tutto nell’ottica della scelta della corretta scuola secondaria di secondo grado. I ragazzi, accompagnati dai professori, hanno mostrato interesse e fatto domande. Speriamo di essere stati d’aiuto nella scelta del loro percorso di studi che li preparerà alla vita lavorativa. In bocca al lupo ragazzi!",

The complex loading process involved precise tandem lifts, performed with a SENNEBOGEN 5500 E Crawler Crane, working in tandem with another crane.\n\nThe machines are now traveling via inland and ocean vessels to their final destination in Charleston, South Carolina. 🇺🇸 This water route cuts CO₂ emissions by 75%, saving 49 tons compared to road transport. ✅\n\nRead more here: ➡️ https://bit.ly/3WvwUeZ\n(Link in Instagram Bio.)\n\n#HeavyLifting #GreenLogistics #Sustainable #Sustainability #Nachhaltigkeit #CrawlerCrane #Raupenkran #MOVEBIGTHINGS #SENNEBOGEN with hafen.straubing.sand & sennebogen.na",

After so many decades, the wear and tear of time had taken a heavy toll on the machine, which had to be dismantled and painstakingly restored.
