As the steel industry moves toward sustainable practices, electric arc furnaces are becoming central to expansion plans, while countries like China are raising the bar on quality standards for imported materials.\n\nLooking further ahead, scrap demand is expected to reach 964 million tons by 2050 – a milestone aligned with global steel producers‘ ambitions for carbon neutrality.\n\nAt LINDEMANN Metal Recycling, we are proud to support this transformation of the circular economy by delivering innovative solutions that ensure a sustainable and efficient use of resources for a better tomorrow.\n\nSteel’s green future is being forged with scrap.

This Lefort shear/baler is proving to be a real head turner as it sits proudly at the top of their yard. \n\n💥 Delivered to site in three main pieces the machine is assembled on a foundation frame and commissioned within two weeks. The machine is very productive on all grades of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, shearing with the 1000T window crosshead or baling with the 180T baling ram. \n\n💪🏽 The power, strength and speed of its cutting is giving very pleasing results for its new owners. This machine, fitted with the 600HP Scania diesel engine, operators control cabin and tunnel pusher ram is easily capable of 25-30 Tonnes per hour of production, depending upon material and cut length. \n\nWe wish Philip & Stephen all the best for the future with their new Lefort Koloss 1000 TS 🙌",

I ragazzi, divisi a gruppi, hanno visitato l’officina e gli uffici della ditta dove sono state spiegate loro le varie figure professionali. Il tutto nell’ottica della scelta della corretta scuola secondaria di secondo grado. I ragazzi, accompagnati dai professori, hanno mostrato interesse e fatto domande. Speriamo di essere stati d’aiuto nella scelta del loro percorso di studi che li preparerà alla vita lavorativa. In bocca al lupo ragazzi!",

Um in dieser kritischen Situation schnell und effizient zu handeln, hat das Wasserstraßen- und Schifffahrtsamt (WSA) Mosel-Saar-Lahn seit Jahren einen Rahmenvertrag mit dem Trierer Kranverleih-Experten Steil Kranarbeiten. \n\nDank dieser Zusammenarbeit und modernster #Liebherr-Technik konnte das beschädigte Tor geborgen und ein neues eingebaut werden. Dazwischen spielte ein Liebherr-Mobilkran die Hauptrolle bei der Notschleusung von 74 auf der Mosel festsitzenden Schiffen.\n\n👉 Mehr dazu lesen: https://go.liebherr.com/qdu91g",
