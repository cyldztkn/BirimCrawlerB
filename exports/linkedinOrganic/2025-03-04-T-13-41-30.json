Steel industry expert Dr. Christian Fröhling from SMS took centre stage with a keynote exploring the role of electric arc furnaces, regulatory pressures, and the role recycled steel/scrap will play in the developing global demand for green steel.🌱\n\nHis insights reinforced the industry’s need for improved density and purity – as well as innovation, collaboration and a strong commitment to decarbonization.\nAttendees then had the unique opportunity to tour S. Norton Group’s advanced recycling facility, featuring the world’s first LINDEMANN shredder with the revolutionary Variable Frequency Drive (VDA) technology, as well as Shredder Drive Assist (SDA). Seeing innovation in action capped off an event that was not just about discussion — but about real solutions and a better way forward for the industry.♻️\n\nFrom thought-provoking keynotes to hands-on experiences, LINDEMANN’s Customer Advisory Board was a milestone moment for the industry. This event underscored the power of partnership in shaping a stronger, more sustainable future for metal recycling.\n\n🎥 Watch the video to see the highlights from Day 2!\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #CleanerPlanet #CircularEconomy #CarbonReduction #TheCAB #Manchester #England #event #SNorton",

Over two days, delegates from all over Europe – and as far afield as Canada – discussed the future of metal recycling, emerging trends, challenges, and how the industry can drive meaningful change.\n\nFollowing an opening address by LINDEMANN CEO Carl Gustaf Göransson, Past President of the Bureau of International Recycling, Tom Bird, delivered a powerful keynote, emphasizing that while the industry is already green, it must do more to communicate its sustainability credentials. This set the stage for insightful presentations from LINDEMANN’s leadership team, outlining the company’s strategic vision, advancements in technology and a commitment to supporting customers with new business models and closer after-sales partnerships. 📣🤝\n\nBut CAB wasn’t just about presentations — it was a collaborative platform where industry voices were heard. Lively discussions and interactive sessions captured key challenges and opportunities, ensuring that customer perspectives are at the heart of future innovations. Participants even got to go toe-to-toe with the professional table tennis athletes from the LINDEMANN-sponsored Borussia Düsseldorf e.V. team in Germany!\n\n📽️ Watch the video to relive the energy, insights, and collaboration from Day 1!\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #CleanerPlanet #CircularEconomy #CarbonReduction #TheCAB #Manchester #England #event",

Today we were pleased to welcome a group of senior leaders from the metals recycling industry, representing companies from across Europe. The group have been attending a Lindemann industry event being held in Manchester and took the opportunity to visit S. Norton’s £20m world-class shredder installation at our Manchester site. This ambitious investment in recycling technology has increased scrap metal shredding capacity by 50% and produces higher quality ferrous and non-ferrous metals - all while delivering sustainability gains including reduced emissions to atmosphere and lower energy consumption.\n#LindemannMetalRecycling #Metals #Recycling #Sustainability #ManchesterToday we were pleased to welcome a group of senior leaders from the metals recycling industry, representing companies from across Europe. The group have been attending a Lindemann industry event being held in Manchester and took the opportunity to visit S.

In the crane, thanks to the automatic cycle, our operator can prepare the next load while the scrap previously loaded is still being processed. No time is lost ! » Charles Bornes \n\nM. Bornes also prizes the total cooperation shown throughout the project including the recommendations for the most efficient layout of the machine on site, the supply of the civil engineering guide drawings, the logistic operations, the assembly & commissioning of the machine, not forgetting the training of operators and technicians.\n\n🤝 Thanks again to the Bornes family for their trust.",

J’ai eu la chance d’intégrer l’OFJ lors des sessions 2006, 2007 et 2008.\n\nAvec du recul, il est évident que l’orchestre m’a apporté énormément en termes de management et de conduite de projet. Être musicien d’orchestre, c’est savoir faire du lien entre les éléments, écouter, s’exprimer, apprendre à gérer son stress, anticiper une échéance, rebondir après un échec.

Durch effiziente Prozesse können sie nicht nur wiederverwertet, sondern auch zu einem wichtigen Beitrag für die Kreislaufwirtschaft gemacht werden. 🌍🔩\n\nWie funktioniert der Recyclingprozess?\n1️⃣ Spänebrechen: Sperrige, lange Späne werden mit unserem Spänebrecher zerkleinert, sodass sie einfacher zu handhaben sind. Dies reduziert das Volumen und verhindert Probleme wie Verstopfungen in der Weiterverarbeitung.\n2️⃣ Brikettierung: Die gebrochenen Späne werden in unseren Brikettierpressen verdichtet.\n✅ Das Volumen wird um bis zu 90 % reduziert.\n✅ Kühl- und Schmiermittel werden sauber zurückgewonnen.\n✅ Es entstehen kompakte, hochwertige Briketts, die sich ideal recyceln lassen.\n\nWarum ist das wichtig?\n🌱 Ressourcenschonung: Weniger Abfall, mehr Wiederverwertung.\n⚙️ Effizienz: Gebrochene Späne und Briketts sind leichter zu transportieren und zu schmelzen.\n💡 Nachhaltige Produktion: Unternehmen sparen Kosten und tragen aktiv zur Kreislaufwirtschaft bei.\n\nVom ersten Schritt des Spänebrechens bis zum fertigen Brikett – unsere Lösungen helfen, Produktionsabfälle in wertvolle Rohstoffe zu verwandeln.\n\n📌 Erfahren Sie mehr über unsere Technologie und wie sie Ihre Prozesse nachhaltiger gestalten kann.

Greater efficiency, lower costs, less waste. Watch the shredder in action and see the difference!\n\n#ZATO #ZatoShredder #RecyclingEquipment #MetalRecycling #BlueDevil",

Military AND space exploration to be another demand sector.\n\nAlcoa says that with Alumina prices at all time highs, aluminum actually has more demand and is going to benefit.\n\nBank of America charts show aluminum supply growth has waned the last 4 years while demand for aluminum products has grown significantly. \n\nWhy does this matter to recyclers?\n\nSimilar to ferrous markets recently, as melt shops expand into more local US markets, they will need clean, sized, sorted material. Mixed aluminum and non-ferrous goods may keep you alive, but refined, specific grades keeps you growing.\n\nOur job at Zato is easy, keep supplying customers with equipment to create liberated, sized material for sorting. Low quality in, high quality out, under one roof.\n\nBlue Devil Twin Shaft Shredder: debales and pre-shreds full size aluminum scrap.\n\nBlue Marlin Single Shaft Shredder: downsizes extrusions and profiles to screen and sort.\n\nBlue Shark Compact Hammermill: shreds any aluminum material to a uniform size, liberate contaminants, and allow the best sorted product to be made.",
