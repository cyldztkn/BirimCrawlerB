That’s why we now offer machines built with green steel – and by \"green,\" we don’t just mean our signature color. 🟢\n\n🍃 \"Green steel\" refers to CO₂-reduced, more sustainable steel production, which we can offer now in partnership with salzgitterag and its subsidiary deumu_gmbh (Deutsche Erz- und Metall-Union GmbH). Compared to conventional steel production, this enables CO₂ savings of more than 70%.\n\nOur very first green steel machine is one of our newly launched 40 t SENNEBOGEN 830 G material handlers, a model already known for its exceptional efficiency. With green steel we are cutting up to 20 tons CO₂ emission per machine.\n\nSENNEBOGEN now offers comprehensive implementation of this option for all models on request.\n💡 Learn more here: ➡️ https://bit.ly/4jcIOTT\n\n🔜 See the first \"double green\" 830 G live at bauma Munich 2025, April 9-13!\n📍 SENNEBOGEN booth, outdoor area FM.712\n➡️ https://bauma.sennebogen.com\n\n(All links in Instagram bio.)\n\n#GreenSteel #Stahl #Sustainability #Nachhaltigkeit #decarbonization #scope3 #MaterialHandling #Umschlagbagger #MaterialHandler #bauma2025 \n#MOVEBIGTHINGS with #SENNEBOGEN, the #GreenHeartofbauma 💚",
