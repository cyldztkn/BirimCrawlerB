As the steel industry moves toward sustainable practices, electric arc furnaces are becoming central to expansion plans, while countries like China are raising the bar on quality standards for imported materials.\n\nLooking further ahead, scrap demand is expected to reach 964 million tons by 2050 – a milestone aligned with global steel producers‘ ambitions for carbon neutrality.\n\nAt LINDEMANN Metal Recycling, we are proud to support this transformation of the circular economy by delivering innovative solutions that ensure a sustainable and efficient use of resources for a better tomorrow.\n\nSteel’s green future is being forged with scrap. Are we ready to meet the challenge? 💪✨\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #Steel",
