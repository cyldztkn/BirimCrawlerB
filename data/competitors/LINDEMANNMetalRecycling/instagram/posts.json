As the steel industry moves toward sustainable practices, electric arc furnaces are becoming central to expansion plans, while countries like China are raising the bar on quality standards for imported materials.\n\nLooking further ahead, scrap demand is expected to reach 964 million tons by 2050 – a milestone aligned with global steel producers‘ ambitions for carbon neutrality.\n\nAt LINDEMANN Metal Recycling, we are proud to support this transformation of the circular economy by delivering innovative solutions that ensure a sustainable and efficient use of resources for a better tomorrow.\n\nSteel’s green future is being forged with scrap. Are we ready to meet the challenge? 💪✨\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #Steel",

From the material preparation of the scrap, separation of the fractions and the proven reduction of emissions right up to the result analysis which evaluates the purity level of the processed material: LINDEMANN is committed to the green steel cycle.\n\nInstead of discarding components at the end of their ‘first life’, we refurbish them to as-new condition. This ‘second life’ conserves raw materials, while the process requires only a fraction of the energy needed to manufacturing components from scratch. \n\nWe are also working to reduce indirect emissions that occur along our value chain, by selecting suppliers that share our environmental goals. \n\nAt LINDEMANN, we’re fueling the green transformation. Solutions like our 400 bar hydraulic technology, Variable Frequency Drive (VFD), and Shredder Drive Assistant (SDA), are designed to make recycling smarter, cleaner, and more efficient. We’re reducing emissions, optimizing energy use, and giving scrap a new life in the steel cycle.\n\nThe future of steel is green – and it’s happening now. 🔄💚\n\n#GreenSteel #Sustainability #CircularEconomy #Recycling #LINDEMANN #ClimateAction #EcoEfficiency",

    "caption": "From Düsseldorf to Texas – A Legacy Forged in Steel\nIt all began in 1913, when LINDEMANN launched its first baler press in Düsseldorf. What followed was more than a century of innovation, engineering excellence, and a growing global footprint.\nOne of the defining milestones came in 1958, when LINDEMANN delivered the world’s first hydraulically operated scrap shear – a 1,200-ton powerhouse – to Luria Brothers, then the largest scrap company in the United States.\nDeveloped in cooperation with Lake Erie, a hydraulics company based in Buffalo, this groundbreaking machine marked the beginning of the hydraulic scrap shear era in North America. Many more followed, helping shape an entire industry.\nFast forward to the early 1980s, when the next chapter began:\nThe story of Texas Shredder took off in San Antonio, Texas, starting with spare parts and consumables for shredders. By 1986, the first Texas Shredder was delivered to Southern Iron & Metal in Beaumont, TX.\nSince then, nearly 120 shredders have been built and installed—most of them in North America—solidifying the Texas Shredder name as a symbol of heavy-duty reliability.\nToday, that legacy continues in products like the TXS 69x90 modular shredder, combining decades of proven experience with the smart performance needed for tomorrow’s scrap processing.\nFrom Düsseldorf to Texas – and far beyond – LINDEMANN continues to shape the future of metal recycling with deep roots, bold ideas, and strong customer partnerships.\n🌍 Global roots.

The demand for aluminum scrap in the EU will increase to 9 million tons in the next few decades (demand for aluminum by 50%) \n\nWhy Aluminium:\n\n♻️ Aluminum is infinitely recyclable – without losing quality.\n🔁 75% of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today.\n⚡ Using aluminum scrap instead of primary aluminum saves 95% of the energy.\n💡 That’s up to 14,000 kWh saved per ton of recycled aluminum.\n⚠️ Producing 1 ton of primary aluminum requires around 13.5 MWh of electricity.\n✅ Recycling needs just 0.67 MWh – only 5% of the energy.\n🌱 The environmental impact? Aluminum scrap reduces CO₂ emissions by 92% compared to primary production.\n📊 Globally, the production of secondary aluminum is now twice as high as that of primary aluminum.\n✅ The result:\nAluminum scrap is no longer just waste – it’s the most important raw material for aluminum production.\nAt LINDEMANN, we build machines that make this possible.\nEfficient.

That’s why we’re raising the bar – and introducing a smarter solution:\nWe are transitioning from traditional bandaged welded caps to segmented welded caps – designed for longer life, higher reliability, and easier customization.\n\nWhat’s changing – and why it matters?\n\n✅ Production of the new caps has already started\n✅ Full transition expected by mid-2025 (based on remaining stock)\n✅ Initial results: Improved durability, reduced stress points, and better long-term value\n\nTested in the field – shaped by reality\n\nEarly adopters are already running segmented caps under tough conditions – and the results are promising. But we’re not stopping there:\nWe’re developing multiple variants to suit different machine types and applications – and we’re involving real customers in the test phase to ensure practical performance, not just lab success.\n\nWhy this matters for you?\n🔹 Higher efficiency and fewer shutdowns\n🔹 More predictable wear behavior\n🔹 Better cost control through longer life cycles\n🔹 A solution built on 100+ years of experience – and on your feedback\n🔹 This is just one of many steps we’re taking to redefine wear part performance in metal recycling.
