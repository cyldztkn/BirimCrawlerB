What followed was more than a century of innovation, engineering excellence, and a growing global footprint.\nOne of the defining milestones came in 1958, when LINDEMANN delivered the world‚Äôs first hydraulically operated scrap shear ‚Äì a 1,200-ton powerhouse ‚Äì to Luria Brothers, then the largest scrap company in the United States.\nDeveloped in cooperation with Lake Erie, a hydraulics company based in Buffalo, this groundbreaking machine marked the beginning of the hydraulic scrap shear era in North America. Many more followed, helping shape an entire industry.\nFast forward to the early 1980s, when the next chapter began:\nThe story of Texas Shredder took off in San Antonio, Texas, starting with spare parts and consumables for shredders. By 1986, the first Texas Shredder was delivered to Southern Iron & Metal in Beaumont, TX.\nSince then, nearly 120 shredders have been built and installed‚Äîmost of them in North America‚Äîsolidifying the Texas Shredder name as a symbol of heavy-duty reliability.\nToday, that legacy continues in products like the TXS 69x90 modular shredder, combining decades of proven experience with the smart performance needed for tomorrow‚Äôs scrap processing.\nFrom D√ºsseldorf to Texas ‚Äì and far beyond ‚Äì LINDEMANN continues to shape the future of metal recycling with deep roots, bold ideas, and strong customer partnerships.\nüåç Global roots.
