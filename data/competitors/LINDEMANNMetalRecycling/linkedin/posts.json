Replacement? It had already been ordered before the failure, but was still in production for some time. Long story short: machine downtime and loss of production.\n\nIn this situation our service team deeply impressed me:\nInstead of waiting, they checked with another long-standing customer, who they knew had a machine of the same type and a control block in stock.\n\nThe result?
