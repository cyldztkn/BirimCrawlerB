Seeing innovation in action capped off an event that was not just about discussion ‚Äî but about real solutions and a better way forward for the industry.‚ôªÔ∏è\n\nFrom thought-provoking keynotes to hands-on experiences, LINDEMANN‚Äôs Customer Advisory Board was a milestone moment for the industry. This event underscored the power of partnership in shaping a stronger, more sustainable future for metal recycling.\n\nüé• Watch the video to see the highlights from Day 2!\n\n#MetalRecycling #MetalRecyclingSolutions #RecycleForChange #RecycleResponsibly #GreenFuture #RecycleForABetterFuture #CleanerPlanet #CircularEconomy #CarbonReduction #TheCAB #Manchester #England #event #SNorton",
