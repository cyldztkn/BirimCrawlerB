Then came Zato Blue Devil—the twin-shaft shredder that downsizes and densifies light steel scrap, optimizes container loads, and reduces logistics costs.\n\nThe result? Greater efficiency, lower costs, less waste. Watch the shredder in action and see the difference!\n\n#ZATO #ZatoShredder #RecyclingEquipment #MetalRecycling #BlueDevil",

Military AND space exploration to be another demand sector.\n\nAlcoa says that with Alumina prices at all time highs, aluminum actually has more demand and is going to benefit.\n\nBank of America charts show aluminum supply growth has waned the last 4 years while demand for aluminum products has grown significantly. \n\nWhy does this matter to recyclers?\n\nSimilar to ferrous markets recently, as melt shops expand into more local US markets, they will need clean, sized, sorted material. Mixed aluminum and non-ferrous goods may keep you alive, but refined, specific grades keeps you growing.\n\nOur job at Zato is easy, keep supplying customers with equipment to create liberated, sized material for sorting. Low quality in, high quality out, under one roof.\n\nBlue Devil Twin Shaft Shredder: debales and pre-shreds full size aluminum scrap.\n\nBlue Marlin Single Shaft Shredder: downsizes extrusions and profiles to screen and sort.\n\nBlue Shark Compact Hammermill: shreds any aluminum material to a uniform size, liberate contaminants, and allow the best sorted product to be made.",
