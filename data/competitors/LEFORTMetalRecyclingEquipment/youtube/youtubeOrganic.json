      "caption": "LIDEX scrap shear with side compression is particularly suitable for cutting and compacting heavy and bulky scrap metal thanks to the its throat size, its power and side-squeeze force.\n\nThese machines are ideal to reach very high production levels up to 115 t/h with low operating costs. They also can be used for baling and can have a pusher with a press force of either 250 tons or 320 tons for an increased densification of the material.\n\nTill now, the LIDEX is the only scrap shear with side compression to offer a complete automatic cycle that includes discharging of scrap materials from the preload table into the compression box, closing of the box and complete cutting cycle.\n\nThis unique function is made possible mainly by two major innovations:\n\ninnovative kinematics for the preload table which allows dumping of scrap metal directly into the pusher area, and thus reducing the number of movements\n\na high amplitude lid designed to exert exceptional compaction power and efficiency to reduce cycle times.\n\nThe operator who is no longer needed for compression and shearing operations frees up time for carrying out other operations.\n\nThe LIDEX allows productivity gains of 25%",
