In the crane, thanks to the automatic cycle, our operator can prepare the next load while the scrap previously loaded is still being processed. No time is lost ! » Charles Bornes \n\nM. Bornes also prizes the total cooperation shown throughout the project including the recommendations for the most efficient layout of the machine on site, the supply of the civil engineering guide drawings, the logistic operations, the assembly & commissioning of the machine, not forgetting the training of operators and technicians.\n\n🤝 Thanks again to the Bornes family for their trust.",

Thanks to continuous investment, we are continuing to grow and constantly optimising our operational performance.\n\nWe have recently installed a new KONKEROR700 electric shear press with a capacity of 1,000 tons. This equipment enables us to cut all types of scrap metal, compact it to increase load density, and ensure direct shipment to foundries.\n\nWe also provide skips of various sizes for the collection of non-hazardous industrial waste (NIW), such as cardboard, wood, and miscellaneous waste. Our weighbridges allow us to weigh quantities in real time, offering our customers a responsive service and exemplary traceability.\nEvery day, we take concrete action to promote more efficient, sustainable, and forward-looking recycling.\n\n👉 Feel free to contact our sales representative PATRICE DELCOURT to learn more about our services or get a personalized quote.",
