In the crane, thanks to the automatic cycle, our operator can prepare the next load while the scrap previously loaded is still being processed. No time is lost ! » Charles Bornes \n\nM. Bornes also prizes the total cooperation shown throughout the project including the recommendations for the most efficient layout of the machine on site, the supply of the civil engineering guide drawings, the logistic operations, the assembly & commissioning of the machine, not forgetting the training of operators and technicians.\n\n🤝 Thanks again to the Bornes family for their trust.",

The arrival of this new shear/baler confirms the company’s commitment for staying at the forefront of technical progress.\n\nThe decision to acquire a 700-ton TRAX shear was driven by the need to modernize equipment and meet growing production demands. Alan Waugh  expressed his admiration for the flexibility of the TRAX, movable anywhere on the scrap yard.\n\nWith a cutting force of 700 tons and 6.6 m compression box, it is capable of processing large volumes of ferrous and non-ferrous. Each 325-ton press lid, along with a 180-ton pusher, ensures optimal material compression.\n\nThis shear is equipped with a 400 HP diesel engine allowing to process up to 20 t/hr and produce over 30 bales/hr.\n\nThe acquisition of this new TRAX machine marks a turning point for the company, which combines its family tradition with technological innovations to meet the future challenges of scrap metal recycling.We recently delivered a 700-ton TRAX shear to William Waugh (Edinburgh) Limited.
