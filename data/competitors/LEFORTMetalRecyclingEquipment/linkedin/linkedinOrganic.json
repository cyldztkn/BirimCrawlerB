In the crane, thanks to the automatic cycle, our operator can prepare the next load while the scrap previously loaded is still being processed. No time is lost ! » Charles Bornes \n\nM. Bornes also prizes the total cooperation shown throughout the project including the recommendations for the most efficient layout of the machine on site, the supply of the civil engineering guide drawings, the logistic operations, the assembly & commissioning of the machine, not forgetting the training of operators and technicians.\n\n🤝 Thanks again to the Bornes family for their trust.",
